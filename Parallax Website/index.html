			<h5 class="method-header">Parallax Scrolling</h5>
			<p>Parallax scrolling is a technique in computer graphics where background images move past the camera more slowly than foreground images, creating an illusion of depth in a 2D scene of distance. The technique grew out of the multiplane camera technique used in traditional animation since the 1930s. Parallax scrolling was popularized in 2D computer graphics and video games by the arcade games Moon Patrol and Jungle Hunt, both released in 1982. Some parallax scrolling had earlier been used by the 1981 arcade game Jump Bug.</p>

		<p>METHOD OF PARALLAX SCROLLING</p>
	</div>
	<div class="parallax3">
		<div class="content1-axis">
			<div class="content-axis-header">
				<p>There are four main methods of parallax scrolling used in titles for arcade system board, video game console and personal computer systems</p>
			</div>
			<div class="method-row">
				<div class="method-cols">
					<div class="method">
						<h5 class="method-header">Layer Method</h5>
						<p>Some display systems support multiple background layers that can be scrolled independently in horizontal and vertical directions and composited on one another, simulating a multiplane camera. On such a display system, a game can produce parallax by simply changing each layer's position by a different amount in the same direction. Layers that move more quickly are perceived to be closer to the virtual camera. Layers can be placed in front of the playfield the layer containing the objects with which the player interacts for various reasons such as to provide increased dimension, obscure some of the action of the game, or distract the player.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="method-cols">
					<div class="method">
						<h5 class="method-header">Sprite Method</h5>
						<p>Programmers may also make pseudo-layers of sprites individually controllable moving objects drawn by hardware on top of or behind the layers if they are available on the display system. For instance Star Force, an overhead-view vertically scrolling shooter for NES, used this for its starfield, and Final Fight for the Super NES used this technique for the layer immediately in front of the main playfield. The Amiga computer has sprites which can have any height and can be set horizontal with the copper co-processor, which makes them ideal for this purpose.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="method-cols">
					<div class="method">
						<h5 class="method-header">Repeating pattern/animation method</h5>
						<p>Scrolling displays built up of individual tiles can be made to 'float' over a repeating background layer by animating the individual tiles' bitmaps in order to portray the parallax effect. Color cycling can be used to animate tiles quickly on the whole screen. This software effect gives the illusion of another (hardware) layer. Many games used this technique for a scrolling star field, but sometimes a more intricate or multi-directional effect is achieved, such as in the game Parallax by Sensible Software.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="method-cols">
					<div class="method">
						<h5 class="method-header">Raster method</h5>
						<p>In raster graphics, the lines of pixels in an image are typically composited and refreshed in top-to-bottom order with a slight delay (called the horizontal blanking interval) between drawing one line and drawing the next line. Games designed for older graphical chipsets such as those of the third and fourth generations of video game consoles, those of dedicated TV games, or those of similar handheld systems take advantage of the raster characteristics to create the illusion of more layers.</p>

			<p>PARALLAX SCROLLING IN WEB DESIGN</p>
		</div>
	<div class="parallax4">
		<div class="content-axis">
			<p>One of the first implementations of parallax scrolling in the browser was created and shared in a blog post by web developer Glutnix in 2007, this included example code and a demo using Javascript and CSS2 that supported IE6 and other browsers of that era. However, it wasn't until 2011 and the introduction of HTML5 and CSS3 coding that the technique became popular with Web designers. Advocates argue it is a simple way to embrace the fluidity of the Web. Proponents use parallax backgrounds as a tool to better engage users and improve the overall experience that a website provides. However, a Purdue University study, published in 2013, revealed the following findings: "... although parallax scrolling enhanced certain aspects of the user experience, it did not necessarily improve the overall user experience".</p>
